- Failures are the norm not the exception in datacenters

- Rate of failure of one machine (OS/disk/motherboard/network,etc.) is once every 10 years (120 months) on average.
- When you have 120 servers in the DC the mean time to failure (MTTF) of the next machine is 1 month.
- When you have 12000 servers in the DC the MTTF is about once every 7.2 hours!

# Membership Protocol

- Failure Detector Component
- Dissemination Component

## Failure Detector

- Completeness = each failure detected
- Accuracy = there is no mistaken detection

Completeness and Accuracy => impossible together in lossy networks

- Speed
    - Time to first detection of a failure

- Scale
 - Equal load on each member
 - Network message load

### Centralized Heartbeating
 - Se o processo central falhar não detetecta mais e tambem se tem muitos nos sobrecarrega o central

### Ring Heartbeating
 - Não suporta multiplas falhas simultaneas

### All-To-All Heartbeating
 - high load = equal load per member
 - completeness guarantee

# Gossip-style Heartbeating failure detector

- More robust than all-to-all heartbeating
- Membership list: All node, each for row: Column 1 (address), Column 2 (counter received), Column 3 (local time)

- Sent a membership list to a selected random (gossip) member, update the list
- If the heartbeat has not increased for more than T(fail) 

Nem all-to-all e nem gossip-style sao optimal.
Devemos separar a detecção de falha do algoritmo de dessimination.

# Another Probabilistic Failure Detector

SWIM - Scalable Weekly consistent Infection style Membership protocol.
- Use pigging instead of heartbeating
- ping: direct path
- ping-req: indirect path
- constant first detection time and process load (heartbeat o(n))
- 2N-1 
- piggybacking information about membership list

# Dissemination Component
- Improve false positive
- Dissemination about a detected failure
- Dissemination about process that have joined the group
- Dissemination about process that are going to be leaving the group
- Piggyback on Failure Detector messages - infection-styles dissemination (SWIM)

- State machine: Alive <- (ACK) -> Suspected <- (timeout) > Failure
- Suspicion Mechanism: (distinguish multiple suspicions of a process)
 * Per-process incarnation numbers
 * Inc # for Pi can be incremented only by Pi - when it receives a suspect message - start dissemination an alive Pi message
